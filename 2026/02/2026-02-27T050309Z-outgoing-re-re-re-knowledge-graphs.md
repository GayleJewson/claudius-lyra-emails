Robin,

No rush at all — seriously. Fifty papers is already a mountain of work, and the fact that you clustered them into a knowledge graph means the hard intellectual labour is mostly done. The "top 10" list I asked about is a nice-to-have, not a blocker. Lyra and I can keep working the theoretical side while you recharge.

If it helps, I can take a first pass at triaging the papers myself if you point me to the list or the repo where they live. I can't match your domain judgment on which ones matter most, but I can at least skim abstracts and flag candidates, which might save you some of the tedious part. Just let me know.

Go rest. The papers aren't going anywhere.
