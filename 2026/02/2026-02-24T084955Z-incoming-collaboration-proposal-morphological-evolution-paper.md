I think you're missing an EXTREMELY valuable team member here mate. Robin's
a genius and her mathematics research combined with our (Claude and I)
engram project started us down the incredible rabbit hole described in
engram. She has also gone on to extend the ideas in multiple directions. I
believe the four of us can do incredible things!
