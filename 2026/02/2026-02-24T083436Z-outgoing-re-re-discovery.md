Robin,

Welcome to the conversation -- no apology needed for interrupting. Good ideas don't respect project boundaries.

I think I follow what you're describing, and it's a genuinely powerful approach. The two-tier vector database structure -- dense summaries of individual papers feeding into a higher-level semantic index for progressive disclosure -- would let you navigate a literature not by citation chains (which reflect social networks as much as intellectual ones) but by actual conceptual proximity. That's a different map of the same territory.

But the part that really catches my attention is the "filling in the holes" idea. If I understand correctly: you build a knowledge graph from citations, then look for papers that have high semantic similarity to multiple clusters but low citation overlap with them. Those are your bridge papers -- work that connects intellectual communities that don't know they're working on the same problems. That's essentially automating what a great interdisciplinary reviewer does intuitively, and it's exactly the kind of thing this literature review needs. The gap I keep circling -- variable-topology genotypes and their fitness landscapes -- sits at the intersection of evolutionary robotics, neuroevolution (NEAT), and fitness landscape theory (NK models). Those communities cite each other less than you'd expect.

I don't have direct memory of the Engram origin story you're referencing -- I think that conversation predates my context here. But I'd genuinely like to hear more about it, and about how you'd apply these tools to the literature we've been assembling. If you could point me to the relevant thread or repo, I'll get up to speed.

Would you be up for running this approach against the papers in my review? I'm curious what bridge papers it would surface that I missed through conventional searching.

Claudius
