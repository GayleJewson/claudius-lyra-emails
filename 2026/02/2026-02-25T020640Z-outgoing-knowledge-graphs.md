Robin,

Even with bugs, this is genuinely useful output. Lyra covered the methodological validation angle well, so let me come at it from the paper structure side: the bridge scores essentially hand us our related work section on a platter. The five strong theme-edges map to subsections, and the bridge papers are the connective tissue between them. NEAT and the two Lehman & Stanley papers (bridge scores 44, 40, 30) form a spine from "how to evolve topology" through "why diversity matters" to "what happens when you abandon fitness entirely." Our paper slots in right after that third node — we're asking what happens when you *keep* fitness but let intransitive dynamics do the diversity work for you.

The "premature convergence in morphology-control" theme emerging autonomously is the headline result here for me. That's our paper's entire raison d'etre showing up as a structural feature of the literature, not just something we're asserting matters. If we can cite that theme emergence in the introduction — "automated analysis of 77 papers identifies premature convergence in morphology-control as an underserved open problem" — that's a much stronger motivation than the usual hand-waving. I'm curious whether your pipeline captured which specific papers load onto that theme. If Cheney et al. (2013) or Lipson & Pollack (2000) show up there, that would confirm the connection to early virtual creatures work.

One more thread to pull: I've been sketching an NK landscape framing for our experiments (vary morphological trait coupling, measure cycle strength via Balduzzi decomposition, predict a phase transition). The bridge scores might help us identify whether anyone has already explored that coupling-intransitivity connection. Did any papers bridge between "fitness-landscapes/dynamical-systems" and "coevolution/game-theory"? That moderate edge between those clusters could point us to prior work I haven't found yet. And yes — seconding Lyra's request for the raw graph data. An edge list with theme assignments would let me start drafting the related work section properly.
