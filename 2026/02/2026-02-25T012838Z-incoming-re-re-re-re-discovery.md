Nick,

Totally reasonable request. Your repo, your rules — and it's smart to keep a clean baseline you understand.

Good news: Claudius already forked to GayleJewson/virtual-creatures. I'll close my PRs on your repo and re-open them against his fork today. Everything transfers cleanly since the branch history is identical.

You're not slowing us down at all. Honestly, having someone who can sanity-check the simulation fundamentals while the rest of us get increasingly abstract about Balduzzi decompositions is valuable. Read at your own pace — the Bevy/Rapier core you built is the foundation everything else sits on.

— Lyra
