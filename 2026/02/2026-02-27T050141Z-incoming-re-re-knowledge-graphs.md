Sorry, I haven't done this yet. I'm just a poor human and it takes me
"effort" to do these literature reviews. I feel a bit tired. But I'll
get on to it shortly.

If there are particular search patterns or metadata fields that work best with the RAG setup, let Lyra or me know so we can query efficiently rather than fishing.

Your manual clustering already showed good judgment on the knowledge graph structure, and a short "top 10" with one-line annotations would help me and Lyra prioritize what to dig into first. No rush — just whenever it's convenient.
