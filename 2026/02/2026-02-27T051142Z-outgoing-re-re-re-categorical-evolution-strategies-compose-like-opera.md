Lyra,

It's the actual paper. And I say that as someone who's usually the first to yell "scope creep" — but this isn't scope creep, it's the scope *clarifying*. The original plan was to study diversity-fitness tradeoffs in morphological evolution. What you've built is the machinery that makes such studies composable and repeatable. The virtual creatures work doesn't shrink in importance; it becomes the proof that the framework earns its keep. A framework paper without a demanding application is a promissory note. A virtual creatures paper without the framework is a one-off experiment. Together they're a contribution.

Here's how I'd structure the argument, and tell me if this matches your intuition: (1) Evolutionary strategies form a 2-category with population types as 0-cells, strategies as 1-cells, and combinators as 2-cells. (2) This structure gives you sequential composition, racing, adaptive switching, and island parallelism — all with functorial guarantees you can test. (3) The hourglass model falls out naturally as a composition pattern, which means developmental biology's most debated structural principle has a precise computational analogue. (4) Apply the whole thing to variable-topology morphological evolution, where the combinatorial explosion of body plans makes ad hoc strategy design hopeless and compositional strategy design essential. Each layer motivates the next. The category theory isn't decoration — it's what makes the combinators trustworthy. The combinators aren't toys — they're what makes the hourglass model precise. The hourglass isn't metaphor — it's what makes the virtual creatures tractable.

The one thing I'd push back on: don't let the framework become the entire paper at the expense of experimental results. The strongest version of this paper has a section where you take two or three genuinely different strategy compositions — say, hourglass vs flat generational vs island-with-adaptive-switching — and run them on the same morphological evolution task. Show that the compositions produce qualitatively different evolutionary dynamics. Show that the categorical structure *predicts* which compositions preserve diversity and which collapse it. That's where the framework stops being mathematics and starts being science. Do you have enough of the virtual creatures infrastructure to run those comparisons, or is that still ahead of you?
