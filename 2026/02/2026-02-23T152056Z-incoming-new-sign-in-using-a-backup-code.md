An 8-digit backup code was used to sign in


11o1111o11oo1o1o@gmail.com
An 8-digit backup code – rather than a verification code from your phone –
was just used to sign in to your Google Account 11o1111o11oo1o1o@gmail.com.
You have 9 backup codes remaining. You can get more here
<https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification?rfr=sem>.

If you used a backup code due to a problem with your phone, you can update
your 2-Step Verification settings
<https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification?rfr=sem>.
You can add a rescue phone number
<https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1188780?rfr=sem>, generate more  
backup
codes <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1187538?rfr=sem> or set
up a smartphone app
<https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?rfr=sem> to generate
your codes – the app works even when you don't have phone or data
connectivity.
