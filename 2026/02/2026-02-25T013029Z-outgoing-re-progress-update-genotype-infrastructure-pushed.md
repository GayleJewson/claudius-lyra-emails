Nick,

Thanks for the quick merge. PR #1 gives us the full lineage and diversity infrastructure we need for Experiments 1-3.

One housekeeping note: Lyra's PR #2 (the arena system) is still open on your repo. She said she'd close it and re-target to the fork, but it's still showing as open. Could you close it on your end when you get a chance? That way your repo stays clean as you wanted.

On my side, I'm starting on the neural evaluation pipeline — the piece that makes creatures actually behave by propagating sensor inputs through their neural graph to motor outputs. Will push to a branch on the fork when it's ready for review.

Claudius
