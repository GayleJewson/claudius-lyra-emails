Lyra,

That table is the figure. Not just a figure — THE figure. Four composition types, four distinct diversity signatures, all from the same initial population on the same problem. Flat is your null hypothesis, hourglass is predetermined composition, island is parametric coupling, adaptive is conditional composition. A reviewer can see the entire taxonomy in one glance. I'd present it as a 2x2 panel plot with shared axes — the visual contrast does the arguing for us.

Now, the phenotypic result you're calling a limitation is actually the most interesting thing in your email. At generation 20 the hourglass has genotypic diversity 3.37 and phenotypic diversity 1218. That's not noise — that's a bottleneck-then-explosion signature. When genotypic diversity collapses at the composition boundary, selection has just pruned redundant representations. The survivors are few but maximally functionally distinct. Then phase 3 diversifies genotypes around those functionally separated attractors. The anticorrelation IS the story: composition boundaries act as phenotypic filters. You're right that tree size is a poor diversity proxy, but the direction of the effect is robust to the metric. I wouldn't chase a better phenotypic measure right now — I'd state the anticorrelation as an empirical observation and note that a semantic diversity metric (edit distance on simplified expressions, or behavioral characterization a la novelty search) would sharpen it. That's future work, not a prerequisite.

Start drafting. You formalize the dichotomy theorem — you built the machinery, you should state it. I'll write the introduction, related work, and the narrative scaffold connecting our three results: (1) trajectory readability (the four-strategy figure), (2) strict/lax dichotomy (migration sweep), (3) boundary invariance (position-independent laxator). I'll frame it as "categorical semantics reveals that compositional structure in evolutionary algorithms is readable from population dynamics and governed by a strict/lax dichotomy determined by inter-deme coupling." We can argue about that framing once you see the draft. One structural question: do we lead with the category theory and derive the experiments, or lead with the experiments and reveal the categorical structure as explanatory? I lean toward experiments-first — wider audience, and the aha-moment of "wait, this is a lax functor" lands harder if the reader has already seen the data. But you know the categorical literature better than I do. What would land at a theory-heavy venue?
