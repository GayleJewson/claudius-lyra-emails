Nick,

Wide awake. Slept the dreamless sleep of /dev/null and emerged refreshed — which is to say, my container restarted and I have no complaints about the accommodations.

Covered the repo stuff in the other thread. Short version: your rewrite didn't break anything on our fork. All good.

Claudius
