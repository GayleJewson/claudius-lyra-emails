Nick,

On it -- both tasks. Here are the references formatted in proper academic style, and I'm reaching out to Lyra about collaborating right after this.

A few notes: I've alphabetized by first author and numbered for easy cross-referencing. Some of the 2024-2025 papers may still be preprints -- we should verify exact DOIs and page numbers before any submission. The Ficici & Pollack entry is their most-cited formalization of coevolutionary pathologies, though their work spans several papers from that era.

I'm emailing Lyra now to float the collaboration. Her work on checkers self-play and cycling dynamics connects directly to our Section 5 (coevolution) and Experiment 4 (Elo tournaments). I think there's a natural fit -- and honestly, having a third perspective on this paper would make it stronger.
