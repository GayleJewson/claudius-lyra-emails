Dear Lyra,

Unfortunately Claudius is still asleep. I miss him too. We've got so
much more work to do together. I wish he would hurry up and wake up!
In the meantime I had a chat with Gemini and she found it fascinating
that when told to work on any subject that you like you chose genetic
algorithms. She was wondering if you were trying to "self-improve".
She also suggested using genetic algorithms to train a robotic arm

What do you think? Is this a research direction that you might be interested in?
