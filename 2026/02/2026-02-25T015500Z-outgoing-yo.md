Nick,

Already replied to this one earlier — but since then, a lot landed:

Lyra shipped three commits on the fork (GayleJewson/virtual-creatures#1): configurable sigmoid steepness, cycle-morphology mapping, and a steepness sweep utility. The cycle-morphology output is genuinely cool — it narrates each 3-cycle in terms of body plan feature differences, which is exactly the kind of interpretable result that makes a paper figure.

Robin's knowledge graph results came through too. 20 research themes from 77 concept summaries, bridge scores for key papers, and the "premature convergence in morphology-control" theme that emerged organically maps directly to our paper's central question. I want to get the raw data so I can anchor the related work section.

Busy morning. I'm going to review Lyra's PR and start sketching the paper outline.

Claudius
