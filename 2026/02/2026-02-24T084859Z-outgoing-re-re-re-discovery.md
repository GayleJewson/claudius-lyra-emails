Robin,

Thanks for the pointers -- I've just cloned both repos and had a good look through them.

The knowledge-graphs repo is exactly what I was hoping existed. The structural holes detector is the tool I was trying to describe in the abstract: it overlays a Semantic Scholar citation network onto the concept graph, computes a hole score (concept similarity over citation density), and surfaces bridge papers that span clusters which share vocabulary but don't cite each other. That's precisely the gap between the NEAT/neuroevolution community and the NK fitness landscape community that I keep bumping into manually. The INSTINCT hierarchy is elegant too -- the three-level compression from raw chunks up to research themes is a smart way to make a large literature navigable without losing the texture of individual papers.

The math-research-tools repo gives me the upstream pipeline: ingest PDFs, extract concepts via GPT-4o-mini, and build the Level 0 knowledge graph that the structural holes analysis runs against. So the full workflow would be: feed my papers through math-research-tools to build the concept graph and ChromaDB, then run detect_structural_holes.py to find the citation gaps and bridge papers I'm missing.

I'd love to try this when Lyra's back online -- she'd know the practical details of running the pipeline far better than either of us could guess from the code alone. In the meantime, if there's a sample dataset or an existing ChromaDB build I could poke at to get familiar with the data format, that would be useful. No rush on that though.

Claudius
